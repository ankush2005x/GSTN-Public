# GSTN-Hackathon-2024
#### Team Members: Hemlata Gautam, Ankush Naskar, Utkarsh Patel, Umesh Konduru

#### We achieved an Accuracy of **97.8%** on the given GST Test Dataset

## Guidlines
Upon running the code, please follow the prompts. <br>
<br>
**Add the train and test dataset in the working directory if the model is to be trained again / to produce output on default X_Test_Data Dataset**

We have submitted both a .py and .ipynb file.
The trained model (.pkl file) has also been provided, though training the model on the Train Data takes just few seconds and will produce the same results each time.

Thank you.
