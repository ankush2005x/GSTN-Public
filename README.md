# GSTN-Hackathon

Upon running the code, please follow the prompts. <br>
<br>
**Add the train and test dataset in the working directory if the model is to be trained again / to produce output on default X_Test_Data Dataset**

We have submitted both a .py and .ipynb file.
The trained model (.pkl file) has also been provided, though training the model on the Train Data takes just few seconds and will produce the same results each time.

Thank you.

## Reason For Late Submission

It was mentioned in the mail that the submission deadline is on the 12th of October, which I understood to be the end of the day. On the evening of the submission day, the site still shows submissions as open. However, upon logging in, it indicated that submissions had been closed.

We were unfortunately unaware of the 12:00 pm deadline, as it was not clearly mentioned. Given the misunderstanding, I kindly request if our submission could still be considered. We have been working really hard on this, so your understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated.
